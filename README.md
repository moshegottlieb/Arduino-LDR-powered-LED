# Arduino LDR powered LED

A simple LDR controlled LED that cycles the LED power using a simple time based step function.  
It also uses simple  [charlieplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlieplexing) to alternately light two leds using 2 wires, and that's because I use it to light my balcony lights.    
Here's a photo showing my poor engineering skills and total inability to solder, but hey, it's a 3â‚¬ smart home appliance :-)
