# Arduino LDR powered LED

A simple LDR controlled LED that cycles the LED power using a simple time based step function.  
It also uses simple  [charlieplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlieplexing) to alternately light two leds using 2 wires, and that's because I use it to light my balcony lights.    
Here's a photo showing my poor engineering skills and total inability to solder, using an arduino nano compatible board (3 for 13€) but hey, it's a 3€ smart home appliance :-)   
Here's an [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3vG7pHR) for the board.
